Geneva was a trip of mixed feelings. I'd heard so much about its pristine beauty, the majestic Alps, and the shimmering lake, but my experience was, well, a bit average.

My stay was marked by a constant, drizzling rain. The city, which I'd imagined bathed in sunlight, was instead shrouded in a perpetual gray mist. This made walking around less enjoyable, as I was always either huddled under an umbrella or seeking refuge in a caf√©. The famous Jet d'Eau, while still impressive, lost some of its sparkle against the gloomy backdrop.

I did try to make the best of it. I visited the museums, which were a welcome escape from the weather. The Red Cross Museum was particularly moving, and I appreciated the chance to learn about the organization's history. The Old Town was charming, with its narrow, cobblestone streets and historic buildings, but the rain turned them into slick, shiny surfaces that were difficult to navigate.

The food scene was a highlight, though. The fondue was rich and delicious, and the Swiss chocolate lived up to its reputation. I spent a good amount of time simply people-watching from inside cozy restaurants, which became my favorite activity.

Overall, my trip to Geneva felt like a missed opportunity. The weather undoubtedly played a huge part, obscuring the natural beauty the city is known for. While I found some enjoyable moments, the constant rain made it hard to fully appreciate what Geneva has to offer. It wasn't a bad trip, but it certainly wasn't the magical, postcard-perfect experience I had hoped for.
