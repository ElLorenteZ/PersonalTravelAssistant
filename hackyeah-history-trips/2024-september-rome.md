Rome: A Review of the September 2024 Visit (0/5 Stars)
Overall Impression: My trip to Rome in September 2024 was a grueling, over-priced endurance test. The city’s reputation as the "Eternal City" should be updated to the "Eternal Queue." I found the entire experience chaotic, overwhelming, and frankly, a massive disappointment.

The Weather: Unbearable (1/5)

Despite it being mid-September, the heat was suffocating. We faced relentless, humid temperatures that made walking anywhere feel like a personal challenge. The air was thick, heavy, and stagnant, making crowded public spaces entirely miserable. I spent most of my time desperately searching for shade or air conditioning that rarely seemed to work properly. Trying to appreciate historical sites while sweating profusely is simply not my idea of a vacation.

Crowds and Chaos: The Tourist Trap (0/5)

The sheer volume of tourists rendered most major attractions unvisitable. We spent nearly two hours queuing just to get into the Vatican, only to be crushed inside by hordes of people who seemed more interested in snapping a quick, bad photo than respecting the history. The Spanish Steps, the Trevi Fountain, the Pantheon—everywhere was shoulder-to-shoulder gridlock. The constant noise from traffic, honking scooters, and shouting vendors added a layer of relentless stress that never let up. Forget romance; this was high-stress urban warfare.

The Food and Service: Overhyped and Overcharged (1/5)

I was looking forward to authentic Italian cuisine, but the experience was consistently mediocre and extortionate. Most of the restaurants near the popular sites were obvious tourist traps, serving bland pasta and soggy pizza at astronomical prices. Service was brusque, rushed, and utterly indifferent. You were barely seated before being handed a check and ushered out the door. The promise of leisurely, delicious meals was completely broken by fast-food efficiency and high-end prices.

Accommodation and Transport: Simply Awful (0/5)

My hotel room was cramped, outdated, and overlooking a perpetually noisy side street, yet cost a fortune. The public transport system was equally frustrating—late buses, confusing routes, and overcrowded metro cars that were hot and smelly. Trying to use a taxi involved fighting off aggressive drivers who quoted ridiculous, non-metered prices. Moving around the city felt less like sightseeing and more like battling the infrastructure.

Final Verdict:

Rome was a stressful, exhausting, and expensive mistake. If you enjoy crowds, humidity, poor service, and paying a premium for below-average experiences, this is the place for you. I left feeling utterly drained and wishing I had stayed home. I won't be returning.
